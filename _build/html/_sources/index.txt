   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Tutorial for Setting up a Complete Django Project
=================================================
This tutorial focuses on how to setup and manage your django project. It doesn't cover how to write a Django app and project as there are many other tutorials on how to do that. Items this tutorial does include:

* :doc:`Setting up a local dev environment (on OS X) <local-setup>`
* Starting a new project
* Building out the project
* Testing
* Documentation
* Pushing the project to production
* Ongoing work process

The tutorial will be easier to follow with a basic understanding of python, Django, and command line usage. If you aren't familiar with these you might want to check out some of the :doc:`resources <learning-resources>` to familiarize yourself with them first first.

.. note:: 

    This tutorial is **how I** set things up and work. It describes methods I've picked up over the last 3 or 4 years that work well for me. There are many other equally valid methods to use so take this tutorial as a guide. If something doesn't work for your process change it, if there is a better way to accomplish something let me know.
